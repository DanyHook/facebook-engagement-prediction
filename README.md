# 📊 Predicting Facebook Post Engagement for a Cosmetics Brand

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores and models a dataset of Facebook posts from a cosmetics brand, with the goal of **predicting the total number of interactions** (likes, shares, comments, etc.) a post may receive based on various post features.

Using Python and machine learning techniques, we apply a **linear regression model** to identify key patterns and assess how well we can estimate engagement levels from the available data.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data structure and key trends.
- Build a **linear regression model** using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.
- Visualize model performance and provide **recommendations for improvement**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy` – data handling and numerical operations  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization and EDA  
- `scikit-learn` – model building and evaluation  

This project serves as a foundational exercise in applying regression analysis to social media data, reinforcing concepts such as feature-target relationships, model evaluation, and prediction accuracy.
